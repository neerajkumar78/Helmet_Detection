3.Related Work<br/>
a) Wen uses a circle arc detection method based upon the Hough transform. They applied it to detect helmet on the surveillance system. The drawback of this work is that they only use geometric features to verify if any safety helmet exists in the set. Geometric features are not enough to find helmets. it proposes a computer vision system aiming to detect and segment motorcycles partly. A helmet detection system is used, and the helmet presence verifies that there is a motorcycle. In order to detect thehelmet presence, the  edges are computed on the possible helmet region. The Canny edge detector is used.<br/>
b) Waranusat  proposed a system to detect moving objects using a k-NN classifier over the motorcyclistâ€™s head to classify helmet. These models were proposed based on statistical information of images and had a limitation to the level of accuracy that could be achieved. <br/>
